# celerytest
OpenGL 4.5 game engine! Inspired by Torque Game Engine 

## Usage
```
$ celerytest w h f
```
- `w` : width
- `h` : height
- `f` : fullscreen flag (1 = on, 0 = off)

## Okay so...
### ...what do I run/make games on?
- CPU minimum: Pentium Silver N5000 (a CPU with AVX would be nice)
- RAM minimum: 1-2GiB (at least 4GB would be nice)
- GPU minimum: Intel UHD6xx Graphics (a video card would be nice)

### ...how do I run this?
- CMake 3.15.x required
- SDL2 (Base / TTF / Image / Net)
- An OpenGL 4.5 runtime should be on your computer.

### ...why?
I was bored. :)
